# PrototypeDNN
Codebase for "Deep Learning for Case-based Reasoning through Prototypes: A Neural Network
that Explains Its Predictions" (to appear in AAAI 2018)
[The implementation of this paper (Original Implementation) can be found in "PrototypeDL-Tensorflow1.x-OG" of this repo]

# PrototypeDNN Tensorflow2.X Implementation
We have reimplemented the traditional Tensorflow1.X implementation of the paper in Tensorflow2.X. Codebase for this can be found in Tensorflow2.X folder.

# AttentionDNN Implementation
We have proposed an alternate approach where we use Attention Mechanism instead of Prototypes to explain the predictions made by the Neural Network. Codebase for this can be found in Tensorflow2.X folder.
